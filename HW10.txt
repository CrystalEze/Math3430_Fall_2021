Question 01)

Briefly describe a computing project you would find interesting to work on in
the future. This project may be

1) Implementing existing mathematics as algorithms, as we have done in this
course.

2) A simple project to learn another computing language.

3) An addition to the linear algebra package from your final project. 

4) A project to learn more complex tools in python. (Such as numpy, scipy,
pandas, machine learning packages such as tensorflow, etc...)

5) A computer application (such as a video game, art tools, music editor, etc..)

6) Any other type of project which I have failed to mention here.


As a future project, I would probably like to work on something like music editing. I have always been
a big fan of music, and now that I know how to write some algorithms; albeit it's for mathematical functions,
I still use the knowledge I possess now to play around with that application. I would also say video games but 
I'm not as huge a fan of veideo games as I am of music.
